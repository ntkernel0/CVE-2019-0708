# CVE-2019-0708-PoC-Hitting-Path
# Really Really Bad, don't judge this code hahaha (it's terrible)
It's only hitting vulnerable path in termdd.sys!!! NOT DOS
Tested only on Windows XP Sp3 x86, Windows 7 will need negotiation part probably so it won't work (I hope that work at all)
Maybe it will be useful for exploit development
